    "title": "What is the Ceiling for Freshman Quarterback?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "In Nebraska, a person does not qualify as a legal adult until the age of 19. That means that an 18-year-old is legally ineligible to do things like rent a car, buy alcohol/tobacco products, enter a casino, serve on jury duty, or even book a room at most hotels.\nWhat can an 18-year-old do? Determine the sanity of millions of Husker football fans for around 5 months of a year.\nIt’s a statement that, although exaggerated, is rooted in truth. The upcoming 2024 season may push this narrative just a bit further as the Husker quarterback room now features two talented freshmen by the names of Dylan Raiola and Daniel Kaelin. Raiola was not only a top recruit in the nation but is also the son of former Husker All-American and Rimington Trophy winner Dominic Raiola. Kaelin is a home-state hero who impressed many and was regarded as one of the top talents in Nebraska hailing from a dynamic offense at Bellevue West High School.\nBoth of the freshmen quarterbacks have their eye on a starting position this fall but they have to beat out junior Henrich Haarberg who won five games last season.\nIt’s no secret that the quarterback play made many fans queasy last year and many are looking to give the talented young bucks a shot. But, the transition to college football is all but easy, and the playing experience is not to be overlooked.\nIt wouldn’t be the first time someone placed their bets on the new kids on the block. Sometimes it works. Sometimes it doesn’t. However, if Husker fans love anything, it’s dreaming about what could be.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(ggbeeswarm)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggtext)\nset.seed(1234)\n\npassing23 &lt;- read_csv(\"qb23.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2023, PlayerSeason = paste(Name, Season))\npassing22 &lt;- read_csv(\"qb22.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2022, PlayerSeason = paste(Name, Season))\npassing21 &lt;- read_csv(\"qb21.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2021, PlayerSeason = paste(Name, Season))\npassing20 &lt;- read_csv(\"qb20.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2020, PlayerSeason = paste(Name, Season))\npassing19 &lt;- read_csv(\"qb19.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2019, PlayerSeason = paste(Name, Season))\npassing18 &lt;- read_csv(\"qb18.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2018, PlayerSeason = paste(Name, Season))\npassing17 &lt;- read_csv(\"qb17.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2017, PlayerSeason = paste(Name, Season))\npassing16 &lt;- read_csv(\"qb16.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2016, PlayerSeason = paste(Name, Season))\npassing15 &lt;- read_csv(\"qb15.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2015, PlayerSeason = paste(Name, Season))\npassing14 &lt;- read_csv(\"qb14.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2014, PlayerSeason = paste(Name, Season))\n\npassing &lt;- bind_rows(passing23, passing22, passing21, passing20, passing19, passing18, passing17, passing16, passing15, passing14)\n\nFreshmen &lt;- passing|&gt;\n  filter(Year == \"FR\")\n\npassing_ratio &lt;- passing |&gt;\n  group_by(Year) |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    Interceptions = mean(Int),\n    Touchdowns = mean(TD),\n  )\n  \npassing_av &lt;- passing |&gt;\n  group_by(Year) |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    Completions = mean(Comp),\n    Attempts = mean(Att),\n  )|&gt;\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = -Year,\n    names_to = \"Stat\",\n    values_to = \"Total\"\n  )\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(data=passing, aes(x=Att, y=Yards), color=\"grey\") +\n  geom_point(data=Freshmen, aes(x=Att, y=Yards), color=\"red\") +\nlabs(\n    x=\"Total Attempted Pass\", \n    y=\"Total Yards\", \n    title=\"What's the Best-Case Scenario?\", \n    subtitle=\"Some familiar and unfamiliar names top the list of recent freshmen phenoms.\", \n    caption=\"Source: cfbstats.com | By Taylor Kumm\") + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n    ) +\n  geom_point(data=Freshmen, aes(x=Att, y=Yards), color=\"red\") + \n  geom_text_repel(data=Freshmen, aes(x=`Att`, y=`Yards`, label = PlayerSeason))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt’s unsurprising to find that some top NFL draft pics are found at the very top of the success metrics of freshmen quarterbacks. C.J. Stroud and Drake Maye’s talents were on display from the moment they stepped on the field. What about Brent Stockstill and Anu Solomon? Solomon would slowly fade out of a starting role at Arizona and would, interestingly enough, transfer to a Matt Rhule-led Baylor team in 2017 before retiring from the game after sustaining a concussion. Stockstill would continue to be an outstanding player at the University of Middle Tennesee but fail to get drafted into the NFL.\nEven if a freshman quarterback plays at a high-level next year. Husker fans should think twice before plotting a space for a statue.\nThe realest fan would acknowledge that the position at Nebraska will be far from absolute perfection. The previous plot displays how even the highest-achieving freshmen quarterbacks failed to set the record books afire.\nMatt Rhule will likely see a high-achieving team if he can place the pressure off of a young quarterback.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(\n    data=passing_av, \n    aes(x=reorder(Year, Total),\n        weight= Total,\n        fill=Stat,)) +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Year Level\", \n    y=\"Quantity\", \n    title=\"Make it easy.\", \n    subtitle=\"History bodes well for quarterbacks that have limited opportunity for error.\", \n    caption=\"Source: CFBData | By Taylor Kumm\") + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt’s not much of a surprise that an average freshman quarterback would take fewer attempts downfield. A good offensive coordinator would acknowledge inexperience and try to get the ball in the hand of a stud running back behind a wall of an offensive line. Surprisingly, freshman quarterbacks are right on track with their completion percentages. This is probably also due to a game strategy that involves easy throws at a low-risk percentage.\nLower the risk of mistakes. Husker fans are quick to acknowledge what exactly the number one “mistake” has been for the large part of the recent Husker football tragedy.\nTurning the ball over.\nIt’s something that has plagued recent seasons and is a stat that most frequently involves the quarterback. If a freshman quarterback is going to succeed this season they are going to need to stop giving the ball away.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_dumbbell(\n    data=passing_ratio, \n    aes(y=reorder(Year,Touchdowns), x=Touchdowns, xend=Interceptions),\n    size = 3,\n    color = \"grey\",\n    colour_x = \"green\",\n    colour_xend = \"red\") +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Interceptions vs. Touchdowns\", \n    y=\"Year Level\", \n    title=\"The Winning Ratio.\", \n    subtitle=\"If &lt;span style = 'color:red;'&gt;interceptions&lt;/span&gt; are on the left, that's good. If &lt;span style = 'color:green;'&gt;touchdowns&lt;/span&gt; are on the left, that's bad.\", \n    caption=\"Source: CFBData | By Taylor Kumm\") + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_textbox_simple(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt’s surprising to see that the top freshman quarterbacks are throwing less interceptions than their upperclassman counterparts. But what jumps off the page is that even at the highest level of play, freshman quarterbacks are still throwing an average of around nine fewer touchdowns a season. Again both of these comparisons may be more revealing of how offensive strategy is built around a younger quarterback. If Coach Rhule’s offense wants to replicate past success from similar situations, he’ll limit the amount of risky throws, especially in the red zone.\nEveryone in the state of Nebraska is anxious to see who take the first snap in late August. However, success for the Cornhuskers will most likely hinge more on the people surrounding the quarterback."
