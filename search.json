    "section": "",
    "text": "In Nebraska, a person does not qualify as a legal adult until the age of 19. That means that an 18-year-old is legally ineligible to do things like rent a car, buy alcohol/tobacco products, enter a casino, serve on jury duty, or even book a room at most hotels.\nWhat can an 18-year-old do? Determine the sanity of millions of Husker football fans for around 5 months of a year.\nIt’s a statement that, although exaggerated, is rooted in truth. The upcoming 2024 season may push this narrative just a bit further as the Husker quarterback room now features two talented freshmen by the names of Dylan Raiola and Daniel Kaelin. Raiola was not only a top recruit in the nation but is also the son of former Husker All-American and Rimington Trophy winner Dominic Raiola. Kaelin is a home-state hero who impressed many and was regarded as one of the top talents in Nebraska hailing from a dynamic offense at Bellevue West High School.\nBoth of the freshmen quarterbacks have their eye on a starting position this fall but they have to beat out junior Henrich Haarberg who won five games last season.\nIt’s no secret that the quarterback play made many fans queasy last year and many are looking to give the talented young bucks a shot. But, the transition to college football is all but easy, and the playing experience is not to be overlooked.\nIt wouldn’t be the first time someone placed their bets on the new kids on the block. Sometimes it works. Sometimes it doesn’t. However, if Husker fans love anything, it’s dreaming about what could be.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(ggbeeswarm)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggtext)\nset.seed(1234)\n\npassing23 &lt;- read_csv(\"qb23.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2023, PlayerSeason = paste(Name, Season))\npassing22 &lt;- read_csv(\"qb22.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2022, PlayerSeason = paste(Name, Season))\npassing21 &lt;- read_csv(\"qb21.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2021, PlayerSeason = paste(Name, Season))\npassing20 &lt;- read_csv(\"qb20.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2020, PlayerSeason = paste(Name, Season))\npassing19 &lt;- read_csv(\"qb19.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2019, PlayerSeason = paste(Name, Season))\npassing18 &lt;- read_csv(\"qb18.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2018, PlayerSeason = paste(Name, Season))\npassing17 &lt;- read_csv(\"qb17.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2017, PlayerSeason = paste(Name, Season))\npassing16 &lt;- read_csv(\"qb16.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2016, PlayerSeason = paste(Name, Season))\npassing15 &lt;- read_csv(\"qb15.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2015, PlayerSeason = paste(Name, Season))\npassing14 &lt;- read_csv(\"qb14.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2014, PlayerSeason = paste(Name, Season))\n\npassing &lt;- bind_rows(passing23, passing22, passing21, passing20, passing19, passing18, passing17, passing16, passing15, passing14)\n\nFreshmen &lt;- passing|&gt;\n  filter(Year == \"FR\")\n\npassing_ratio &lt;- passing |&gt;\n  group_by(Year) |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    Interceptions = mean(Int),\n    Touchdowns = mean(TD),\n  )\n  \npassing_av &lt;- passing |&gt;\n  group_by(Year) |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    Completions = mean(Comp),\n    Attempts = mean(Att),\n  )|&gt;\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = -Year,\n    names_to = \"Stat\",\n    values_to = \"Total\"\n  )\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(data=passing, aes(x=Att, y=Yards), color=\"grey\") +\n  geom_point(data=Freshmen, aes(x=Att, y=Yards), color=\"red\") +\nlabs(\n    x=\"Total Attempted Pass\", \n    y=\"Total Yards\", \n    title=\"What's the Best-Case Scenario?\", \n    subtitle=\"Some familiar and unfamiliar names top the list of recent freshmen phenoms.\", \n    caption=\"Source: cfbstats.com | By Taylor Kumm\") + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n    ) +\n  geom_point(data=Freshmen, aes(x=Att, y=Yards), color=\"red\") + \n  geom_text_repel(data=Freshmen, aes(x=`Att`, y=`Yards`, label = PlayerSeason))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt’s unsurprising to find that some top NFL draft pics are found at the very top of the success metrics of freshmen quarterbacks. C.J. Stroud and Drake Maye’s talents were on display from the moment they stepped on the field. What about Brent Stockstill and Anu Solomon? Solomon would slowly fade out of a starting role at Arizona and would, interestingly enough, transfer to a Matt Rhule-led Baylor team in 2017 before retiring from the game after sustaining a concussion. Stockstill would continue to be an outstanding player at the University of Middle Tennesee but fail to get drafted into the NFL.\nEven if a freshman quarterback plays at a high-level next year. Husker fans should think twice before plotting a space for a statue.\nThe realest fan would acknowledge that the position at Nebraska will be far from absolute perfection. The previous plot displays how even the highest-achieving freshmen quarterbacks failed to set the record books afire.\nMatt Rhule will likely see a high-achieving team if he can place the pressure off of a young quarterback.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(\n    data=passing_av, \n    aes(x=reorder(Year, Total),\n        weight= Total,\n        fill=Stat,)) +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Year Level\", \n    y=\"Quantity\", \n    title=\"Make it easy.\", \n    subtitle=\"History bodes well for quarterbacks that have limited opportunity for error.\", \n    caption=\"Source: CFBData | By Taylor Kumm\") + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt’s not much of a surprise that an average freshman quarterback would take fewer attempts downfield. A good offensive coordinator would acknowledge inexperience and try to get the ball in the hand of a stud running back behind a wall of an offensive line. Surprisingly, freshman quarterbacks are right on track with their completion percentages. This is probably also due to a game strategy that involves easy throws at a low-risk percentage.\nLower the risk of mistakes. Husker fans are quick to acknowledge what exactly the number one “mistake” has been for the large part of the recent Husker football tragedy.\nTurning the ball over.\nIt’s something that has plagued recent seasons and is a stat that most frequently involves the quarterback. If a freshman quarterback is going to succeed this season they are going to need to stop giving the ball away.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_dumbbell(\n    data=passing_ratio, \n    aes(y=reorder(Year,Touchdowns), x=Touchdowns, xend=Interceptions),\n    size = 3,\n    color = \"grey\",\n    colour_x = \"green\",\n    colour_xend = \"red\") +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Interceptions vs. Touchdowns\", \n    y=\"Year Level\", \n    title=\"The Winning Ratio.\", \n    subtitle=\"If &lt;span style = 'color:red;'&gt;interceptions&lt;/span&gt; are on the left, that's good. If &lt;span style = 'color:green;'&gt;touchdowns&lt;/span&gt; are on the left, that's bad.\", \n    caption=\"Source: CFBData | By Taylor Kumm\") + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_textbox_simple(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt’s surprising to see that the top freshman quarterbacks are throwing less interceptions than their upperclassman counterparts. But what jumps off the page is that even at the highest level of play, freshman quarterbacks are still throwing an average of around nine fewer touchdowns a season. Again both of these comparisons may be more revealing of how offensive strategy is built around a younger quarterback. If Coach Rhule’s offense wants to replicate past success from similar situations, he’ll limit the amount of risky throws, especially in the red zone.\nEveryone in the state of Nebraska is anxious to see who take the first snap in late August. However, success for the Cornhuskers will most likely hinge more on the people surrounding the quarterback."

    "text": "It’s 2024 and whether fans like it or not, conference realignment is here.\nGone are the days in which conferences were created based on geography and while many argue that it’s sad and disrespectful to the history of college athletics, it’s hard to deny that conference matchups just got a lot more enticing. In no sport is that more true than football.\nThe shift in realignment is largely due to massive television deals that hinged on college football viewership and sparked the new “mega conferences” of this coming season.\nOne of the most exciting transitions includes the addition of the high-scoring, West Coast teams to the gritty, physical conference that is the Big Ten. Coming this fall, the Big Ten Conference will now consist of 18 teams after the addition of Oregon, Southern California, UCLA, and Washington.\nIt’s an…interesting marriage of two historically different landscapes. The four new teams are from the now-deceased PAC-12 Conference which has been known for executing some of the highest scoring, air-raid offenses while also having some sometimes shotty defense. now the Big Ten Conference is basically known for the inverse of that, having stout defenses and pound-rock offense that slowly wears opponents down.\nWhat commences in 2024 will probably justify those big TV deals with some blockbuster matchups.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(ggbeeswarm)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggtext)\nlibrary(rvest)\nlibrary(gt)\nset.seed(1234)\n\nfirstdownoff &lt;- read_csv(\"firstdownoff.csv\")\nteamstats23 &lt;- read_csv(\"~/Desktop/Sports Data V&A SPMC350/Blog/posts/Introducing-the-Newcomers-to-the-big10/cfbstats/cfb23.csv\") |&gt;\n  separate(Team, into=c(\"School\", \"Conference\"), sep=\"\\\\(\") |&gt;\n  mutate(Conference=gsub(\")\", \"\", Conference))\n\noregon &lt;- teamstats23 |&gt;\n  filter(School == \"Oregon \")\nucla &lt;- teamstats23 |&gt;\n  filter(School == \"UCLA \")\nusc &lt;- teamstats23 |&gt;\n  filter(School == \"Southern California \")\nwash &lt;- teamstats23 |&gt;\n  filter(School == \"Washington \")\nbigten23 &lt;- teamstats23|&gt;\n  filter(Conference == \"Big Ten\")\nfuturebig &lt;- teamstats23|&gt;\n  filter(`Big Ten in 2024`==\"YES\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(data=teamstats23, aes(x=`Off Yards per Game`, y=`Yards Per Game Allowed`), color=\"grey\") +\n  geom_point(data=oregon, aes(x=`Off Yards per Game`, y=`Yards Per Game Allowed`), color=\"forestgreen\") +\n  geom_point(data=wash, aes(x=`Off Yards per Game`, y=`Yards Per Game Allowed`), color=\"purple\") +\n  geom_point(data=usc, aes(x=`Off Yards per Game`, y=`Yards Per Game Allowed`), color=\"maroon\") +\n  geom_point(data=ucla, aes(x=`Off Yards per Game`, y=`Yards Per Game Allowed`), color=\"skyblue\") +\n  geom_point(data=bigten23, aes(x=`Off Yards per Game`, y=`Yards Per Game Allowed`), color=\"black\") +\nlabs(\n    x=\"Offensive Yards Per Game\", \n    y=\"Defensive Yards Allowed Per Game\", \n    title=\"How did the stats stack up in 2023?\", \n    subtitle=\"The most appealing teams from last year can be found in the bottom right quadrant.\nThe newest members are highlighted in their respective colors, while the previous members are in black. \", \n    caption=\"Source: JEFF GALLINI | By Taylor Kumm\") + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) +\n  geom_text_repel(data=oregon, aes(x=`Off Yards per Game`, y=`Yards Per Game Allowed`, label = School))+\n  geom_text_repel(data=ucla, aes(x=`Off Yards per Game`, y=`Yards Per Game Allowed`, label = School))+\n  geom_text_repel(data=usc, aes(x=`Off Yards per Game`, y=`Yards Per Game Allowed`, label = School))+\n  geom_text_repel(data=wash, aes(x=`Off Yards per Game`, y=`Yards Per Game Allowed`, label = School))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImmediately it becomes apparent that the newest teams will bring some extra spark on the offensive side of the ball. However, they will probably be giving up more yards as two of the newcomers top the worst defenses. Not to mention that if the new members would be constantly facing less impressive defenses in the Pac-12, their offensive numbers could also take a hit with the move to a new conference.\n\n\nCode\nfuturebig |&gt;\n  select(School, `3rd Percent`, `Opponent 3rd Percent`)|&gt;\n  arrange(School) |&gt; \n  gt() |&gt; \n  cols_label(\n    `3rd Percent` = \"Offensive 3rd Down Con.\",\n    `Opponent 3rd Percent` = \"Defensive 3rd Down Con.\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_header(\n    title = \"How do they compete on Third Downs?\",\n    subtitle = \"Another reflection of how most of the new teams are opposite in playing styles\"\n  ) |&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"title\")\n  ) |&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"subtitle\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_source_note(\n    source_note = md(\"**By:** Taylor Kumm  |  **Source:**: JEFF GALLINI\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n     locations = cells_column_labels(columns = everything()),\n     style = list(\n       cell_borders(sides = \"bottom\", weight = px(3)),\n       cell_text(weight = \"bold\", size=12)\n     )\n   ) |&gt;\n  opt_row_striping() |&gt; \n  opt_table_lines(\"none\") |&gt;\n    fmt_percent(\n    columns = c(`3rd Percent`, `Opponent 3rd Percent`),\n    decimals = 1\n  ) |&gt;\n data_color(\n    columns = vars(`3rd Percent`),\n    colors = scales::col_numeric(\n      palette = c(\n        \"red\", \"white\", \"green\"),\n      domain = NULL)\n  )|&gt;\n data_color(\n    columns = vars(`Opponent 3rd Percent`),\n    colors = scales::col_numeric(\n      palette = c(\n        \"green\", \"white\", \"red\"),\n      domain = NULL)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do they compete on Third Downs?\n\n\nAnother reflection of how most of the new teams are opposite in playing styles\n\n\nSchool\nOffensive 3rd Down Con.\nDefensive 3rd Down Con.\n\n\n\n\nIllinois\n36.0%\n44.0%\n\n\nIndiana\n37.5%\n36.1%\n\n\nIowa\n29.4%\n31.3%\n\n\nMaryland\n43.6%\n33.9%\n\n\nMichigan\n42.8%\n29.1%\n\n\nMichigan St.\n30.9%\n35.1%\n\n\nMinnesota\n35.2%\n46.0%\n\n\nNebraska\n37.9%\n36.7%\n\n\nNorthwestern\n40.8%\n39.7%\n\n\nOhio St.\n43.6%\n28.6%\n\n\nOregon\n51.0%\n35.8%\n\n\nPenn St.\n40.8%\n30.2%\n\n\nPurdue\n35.8%\n41.2%\n\n\nRutgers\n36.9%\n39.1%\n\n\nSouthern California\n43.4%\n43.6%\n\n\nUCLA\n45.1%\n35.4%\n\n\nWashington\n44.2%\n38.6%\n\n\nWisconsin\n44.2%\n39.6%\n\n\n\nBy: Taylor Kumm | Source:: JEFF GALLINI\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOf course, it’s easy to say that when the new teams play a good defense things will change. Everyone has heard the phrase, “Defense wins championships”.While there is truth in that, what if the big, physical defenses of the former Big Ten get worn out? One can only bend so much before it breaks, and the newcomers are relentless on third-down conversions. Oregon had an astounding 51% conversion rate.\n\n\nCode\nplaysstacked &lt;- firstdownoff |&gt; \n  select(TEAM, `RUFD`, `PAFD`) |&gt; \n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = -TEAM,\n    names_to = \"Type\",\n    values_to = \"Plays\"\n  )\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=playsstacked, aes(x=reorder(TEAM,Plays), weight=Plays, fill=Type)) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"skyblue\",\"forestgreen\"))+\n  coord_flip()+\n labs(\n    x=\"Team\", \n    y=\"Number of First Downs\", \n    title=\"How do they start their drives?\", \n    subtitle=\"A run on first down is displayed in &lt;span style = 'color:forestgreen;'&gt;green.&lt;/span&gt;\nA pass on first down is displayed in &lt;span style = 'color:skyblue;'&gt;blue.&lt;/span&gt;\", \n    caption=\"Source: NCAA | By Taylor Kumm\") + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_textbox_simple(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs previous data alludes to, the newcomers have a significantly larger amount of first downs. Oregon had more than double the amount of first down than Iowa did. However, it doesn’t matter what down it is in a West Coast offense, defenses better be on their toes and there is no sense in packing the box. Rutgers ran on first down about the same as Oregon although they had close to half the amount of first downs.\nSurprisingly while you would expect most all of the long-time members to have heavily skewed bars in favor of running, most of them sit at around 50%\nRegardless, the 2024 Big Ten Conference realignment is like mixing a spicy jalapeno into grandma’s chili recipe—two distinct flavors coming together for an unforgettable taste that has all the elderly nervous. With high-flying West Coast offenses joining the rugged Big Ten, it’s sure to be a season packed with excitement and surprises."
